# Out of Context Beyoncé Bot

This is a twitter bot that periodically tweets out of context Beyoncé lyrics.
Built at [Flawless Hacks 2018](http://flawlesshacks.com).

Note: I believe that there is no context in which Beyoncé is _not_ relevant!

# Getting Started
To get started, clone this repo to your local machine. Copy `.env.example` into a new file called `.env`.

To get this project up and running, you will need to create a new [Twitter] (http://twitter.com) account for your bot.

Once your bot Twitter account is created and verified, go to http://apps.twitter.com and add a new app to your bot's account. Fill out the form as suggested. Enter any URL; you can change it later.
After you create a new app, navigate to the 'Keys and Access Tokens' tab and generate your access tokens. Copy and paste the corresponding Consumer keys and Access keys to the .env
